Selenium IDE Extension needs to be dowloaded from the browser store. Eg.: Chrome Extensions.

After adding the extension, the 'Project-DCSMS.side' selenium file can be imported on the IDE.

For our web-application, you may need the login credentials for Staff login and manager login.

These are sample (test) credentials, which should be working. 
1) Manager Login - 
Login ID - vgudi@umass.edu
Password - vgudi

2) Staff Login - 
Login ID - tbudhwani@umass.edu

After importing, just run he test cases.
